#Description

This is an interactive and responsive navigation menu built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The navigation bar is **fixed** at the top of the page and stays visible as the user scrolls. It features dynamic style changes, such as:

- **Scroll Effect**: The background color and shadow of the navbar change when the user scrolls down the page, providing a sticky effect.
- **Hover Effects**: Menu items change color and scale slightly when hovered over, enhancing interactivity.
- **Responsive Design**: The navigation menu adapts to different screen sizes, stacking vertically on smaller devices like tablets and smartphones.
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Links in the navbar smoothly scroll to their corresponding sections without jumping.

This project demonstrates a modern navigation menu that enhances user experience through dynamic interactions and is mobile-friendly. Perfect for websites that require a fixed navigation menu with interactivity.
